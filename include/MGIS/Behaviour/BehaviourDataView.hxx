   * \brief the stiffness matrix.
   *
   * On input, the first element of K (K[0]) must contain the type of type
   * of computation to be performed.
   *
   * If K[0] is greater than 50, the speed of sound is computed.
   *
   * Let Ke be equal to:
   *
   * - K[0] - 100 if K[0] is greater than 50
   * - K[0] otherwise.
   *
   * If Ke is negative, only the prediction operator is computed and
   * no behaviour integration is performed.
   *
   * Ke has the following meaning:
   *
   * - if Ke is lower than -2.5, the tangent operator must be
   *   computed.
   * - if Ke is in [-2.5:-1.5]: the secant operator must be
   *   computed.
   * - if Ke is in [-1.5:-0.5]: the elastic operator must be
   *   computed.
   * - if Ke is in [-0.5:0.5]: the behaviour integration is
   *   performed, but no stiffness matrix.
   * - if Ke is in [0.5:1.5]: the elastic operator must be
   *   computed.
   * - if Ke is in [1.5:2.5]: the secant operator must be
   *   computed.
   * - if Ke is in [2.5:3.5]: the secant operator must be
   *   computed.
   * - if Ke is greater than 3.5, the consistent tangent operator
   *   must be computed.
   *
   * Other values of K are meant to store behaviour's option. This
   * is currently only meaningful for finite strain behaviours.
   *
   * For finite strain behaviours, K[1] holds the choice of the stress
   * measure used:
   * - if K[1] < 0.5, the Cauchy stress is used
   * - if 0.5 < K[1] < 1.5, the second Piola-Kirchoff stress is used
   * - if 1.5 < K[1] < 2.5, the first Piola-Kirchoff stress is used
   *
   * For finite strain behaviours, K[2] holds the choice of the
   * consistent tangent operator returned by the behaviour:
   * - if K[2]<0.5, the derivative of the Cauchy stress with respect
   *   to the deformation gradient is returned
   * - if 0.5<K[2]<1.5, the derivative of the second Piola-Kirchoff
   *   stress with respect to the Green-Lagrange strain
   *   is returned
   * - if 1.5<K[2]<2.5, the derivative of the first Piola-Kirchoff
   *   stress with respect to the deformation gradient is returned

   * \brief proposed time step increment increase factor
   *
   * The calling solver shall set a suitable value on input
   * depending on its policy befor each call to integrate.
   *
   * For instance, if the solver want to limit the increase to 20% at most, it
   * shall set it to 1.2. But setting it to 1, the solver won't allow the
   * behaviour to request an increase of the time step.
